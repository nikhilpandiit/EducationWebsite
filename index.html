            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’.
                From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and
                administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
                territories.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online learning involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions
                that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual
                classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar
                school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the
                spread of the internet and the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast
                majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online courses.
                As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue
                to transform as well.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Virtual education is becoming increasingly used worldwide. There are
                currently more than 4,700 colleges and universities that provide online courses to their students. In
                2015, more than 6 million students were taking at least one course online, this number grew by 3.9% from
                the previous year. 29.7% of all higher education students are taking at least one distance course. </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The total number of students studying on campus exclusively dropped by 931,317 people between the years
                2012 and 2015. Experts say that because the number of students studying at the college level is growing,
                there will also be an increase in the number of students enrolled in distance learning. </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Instructional models vary, ranging from distance learning types which provide study materials for
                independent self-paced study, to live, interactive classes where students communicate with a teacher in
                a class group lesson.
